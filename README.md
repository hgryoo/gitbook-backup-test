# Overview

CUBRID is an open source project that operates on the basis of a general open source project development process. The developers of CUBRID contribute to one big project called CUBRID by using collaboration tools for open source development projects.

The purpose of this document is to **describe the development workflow using collaborative tools and to establish the basic principles for mutual consensus on a development culture.** This document can be flexibly applied  according to the situation and modify/develop through mutual agreement:

* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools 
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

The CUBRID development process is based on the following two tools:

* Issue Tracking: JIRA \([jira.cubrid.org](http://jira.cubrid.org/)\)
* Code Repository and Code Review: GitHub \([github.com/CUBRID](http://github.com/CUBRID)\)

All CUBRID projects, feature additions, and bug fixes start with the creation of JIRA issues. In accordance with JIRA's Issue workflow, contributors will begin designing and implementing their problem after defining and investigating it. In the design and implementation stage, the code is merged in CUBRID after the review through branch creation, Pull Request, and code review on Github. CUBRID is developed sustainably by repeating the above process.
