When the developer in charge creates a Pull Request and is ready for review, click the 'Submit a fix' button to change it to 'REVIEW IN PROGRESS' status. When code review is completed and code change is merged by the Pull Request, JIRA automatically changes to 'REVIEWED' status through the GitHub hook.
