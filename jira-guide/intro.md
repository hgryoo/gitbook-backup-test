CUBRID uses [JIRA](http://jira.cubrid.org/) to manage projects, and all changes are managed on an issue-by-issue basis. 

JIRA issues have 7 statutes as shown in the above figure:

* OPEN
* CONFIRMED
* IN PROGRESS
* REVIEW IN PROGRESS
* REVIEWED
* RESOLVED
* CLOSED

They are managed by changing the status according to the progress of the issue. When an issue is created at the beginning, the status of the issue will be ‘OPEN’, and every contributing work is finished with ‘CLOSED’.

Each stage has a different person in charge of proceeding with the issue. For example, in the ‘OPEN’ status, the project maintainer triages on the issue; in the 'CONFIRMED' status, the assigned developer proceeds with the development on the issue; in the ‘RESOLVED’ stage, the QA maintainer will close the issue after QA engineers check the result of new test cases and regression tests by CUBRID testing platform. The project maintainer can update and modify the contents of the issue at any status.
